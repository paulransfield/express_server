//passport gotchas
- automates most but not all of the OAuth flow
- additional code setup of passport required
- inherent confusion over how library is structured
- includes 2+ different libraries: passport and passport strategy
- passport library - general helpers for handling auth in Express apps
- passport strategy - for authenticating with one very specific method eg google, github, twitter
- for multiple authentication, you need to import multiple passport strategies
